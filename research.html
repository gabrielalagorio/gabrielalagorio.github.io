    <h1>My Research</h1>
    <p>
      My research centers on the photophysical and photochemical interactions between light and biological materials, with a focus on plant physiology and ecological optics. I employ advanced fluorescence and reflectance-based techniques to investigate pigment dynamics, photosynthetic performance, and stress responses in plants exposed to environmental pollutants such as lead, arsenic, vanadium, herbicides and organophosphates.
    </p>
    <p>
      These studies include the assessments of variable chlorophyll fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence imaging, and steady-state fluorescence. I developed several models to correct fluorescence spectra for light re-absorption and re-emission processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, I explore the functional role of bio-optical signals in animal-plant interactions, including natural fluorescence in amphibians and bird feathers. These studies aim to elucidate how optical traits contribute to ecological communication and signal evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      My work also addresses the translation of bio-optical signals into applied tools, such as fluorescence-based indicators of food quality and biosensors for environmental monitoring using aquatic macrophytes.
